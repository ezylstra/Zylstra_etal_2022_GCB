## Abstract:
Climate change poses a unique threat to migratory species as it has the potential to alter environmental conditions at multiple points along a speciesâ€™ migratory route. Here, we evaluated how the eastern North American migratory population of monarch butterflies is likely to respond to climate changes over the next century on both their spring and summer breeding grounds. Our results reveal that projected changes in breeding-season climate are likely to lead to decreases in monarch abundance, with high potential for the overwintering population size to fall below the historical minimum three or more times in the next two decades. Climatic changes across the expansive summer breeding grounds will also cause shifts in the distribution of monarchs, with higher projected abundances in areas that become wetter but not appreciably hotter. Our forecasts highlight the importance of accounting for the impacts of climate changes throughout the full annual cycle of migratory species.

## Code
1. [MonarchPopulationForecasts.R](Code/MonarchPopulationForecasts.R): R code to run a retrospective full-annual-cycle model for monarchs in eastern North America from 2004-2018, import and format climate projections for the spring and summer breeding grounds, and forecast monarch population sizes in summer and early winter. 
2. [FACM_2004-2018.stan](Code/FACM_2004-2018.stan): Stan model file for running the retrospective population model (called from the R script above). 

## Data for the retrospective population model
All monarch data from the overwintering grounds and covariate data for 2004-2018 are publicly available.  Monarch data from the summer breeding grounds are proprietary and are therefore not publicly available (though we provide descriptions of those data here).
